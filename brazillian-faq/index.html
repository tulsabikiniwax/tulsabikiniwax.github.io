<h3>Frequently Asked Questions About Bikini (Brazilian, runway) Waxing:</h3>
<p><strong>How should I prepare myself before a bikini wax?<br />
</strong>The best way to prepare yourself is to first relax and know your in good hands.  My goal is to make this treatment as pleasant as possible. Normally I suggest to shower or a quick rinse before your appointment.</p>
<p><strong>Could I be waxed during my menstrual cycle?<br />
</strong>Waxing during your menstrual cycle is possible but is not recommended. During your menstrual cycle your body tends to be more sensitive due to the change of hormones and this could cause the treatment to be more painful.</p>
<p><strong>What should I wear?</strong><br />
During the treatment you can leave your panties on or off.  I provide disposable panties for those who choose to leave their panties on.</p>
<p><strong>Will the treatment hurt?<br />
</strong>All depends, first time receiving Brazilian or Playboy waxing can be uncomfortable because after shaving for years the hair grows extremely coarse. The more frequent you receive bikini waxes the hair will begin to grow thinner. Removing hair directly from the follicle is never comfortable, but I am a trained aestheticians and highly experienced.</p>
<p><strong>How often should I get bikini waxed?</strong><br />
Every 3 to 4 weeks is the recommended.</p>
<p><strong>What does a "Runway" mean:?<br />
</strong>Leaves a vertical stripe or triangular shape in the vaginal area, two to three fingers in width.</p>
<p><strong>Process of The Brazilian Bikini Wax:</strong>  Hair is removed from the labia. Hair is removed from behind the tush. Named after the Brazilian women that would wear G-String Bikinis and you could never spot any hair when looking from behind. With the Brazilian it’s not what you leave up front it’s what you don’t leave from behind. Hair is entirely removed from the vaginal area, labia, and from the tush. Just like the name says, it’s bare all. Sometimes this treatment is otherwise known as "The Full Monty" Bikini Wax.</p>
<h3>History of Brazilian Waxing</h3>
<p>Brazilian waxing was introduced to New York by a group of sisters from Brazil: Jocely, Jonice, Joyce, Janea, Jussara, Juracy and Judseia Padilha. They founded the J. Sisters International Salon in midtown Manhattan in 1987, and started offering Brazilian Bikini Waxes. The wax originated in Brazil for women wanting to wear the then-new thong bikinis, which was not widely popular inside the United States at the time. Waxing gained in popularity through the 90’s, with several celebrites, such as Paula Yates and Gwyneth Paltrow, extolling its virtues. In 1999 it shot to international prominence with the airing of a Sex and The City episode, where one of the characters is the unsuspecting victim of a sphinx style Brazilian wax and finds the experience surprisingly pleasant. In the episode it was portrayed as a Los Angeles phenomenon, but in actuality it was first introduced in New York.</p>
